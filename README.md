Sphinx is a free, dual-licensed search server. Sphinx is written in C++, and focuses on query performance and search relevance.

The primary client API is currently SphinxQL, a dialect of SQL. Almost any MySQL connector should work. Additionally, basic HTTP/JSON API and native APIs for a number of languages (PHP, Python, Ruby, C, Java) are provided.
